# IVerbs - An Android App for Irregular Verb Study

Welcome to the repository for IVerbs, an Android application designed to help users study and master irregular verbs. This app was my first experience in Android development, using Kotlin and XML for the views. The app features a comprehensive list of irregular verbs and their corresponding pronunciations generated from web tools, as well as sample sentences for each word to aid in understanding and practice. Whether you're a student learning a new language or just looking to brush up on your verb conjugation, IVerbs is the perfect tool for mastering irregular verbs.

Even though the app may not be perfect from a programming standpoint, it served as the foundation for my development journey and I am proud of what it taught me.
